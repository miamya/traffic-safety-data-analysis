# traffic-safety-data-analysis
Visualize traffic safety data and analyze the relationship between collisions and smartphone usage over time.

Has increasing smartphone usage made us worse drivers?


This project is intended to investigate trends in traffic safety by:

- Visualize trends in car crashes over time.
- Plot changes in key variables like smartphone use.
- Assess the correlation of each variable with collision rates.
- Predict collision rates using linear regression.
